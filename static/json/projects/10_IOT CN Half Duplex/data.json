    "category": "IOT",
    "description": "The project introduces an IoT application that leverages WS2812b individually addressable LEDs to create a hands-on demonstration of packet transmission in a half-duplex network using the stop-and-wait protocol. This engaging application acts as an educational tool, visually guiding individuals through the fundamentals of computer networks by illustrating how packets move within a half-duplex setup.",
